# Work Day Scheduler

The Work Day Scheduler application is built dynamically using jQuery. It allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The availiability of the text areas change, based on the current time of day. Scheduled events are stored into local storage and appear on the scheduler until that hour is saved over.
